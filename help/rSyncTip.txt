# >f.st......
#   > - the item is received
#   f - it is a regular file
#   s - the file size is different
#   t - the time stamp is different


# .d..t......
#   . - the item is not being updated (though it might have attributes that are being modified)
#   d - it is a directory

# The first character indicates what is happening to the file:

#   < means that a file is being transferred to the remote host (sent).
#   > means that a file is being transferred to the local host (received).
#   c means that a local change/creation is occurring for the item (such as the creation of a directory or the changing of a symlink, etc.).
#   h means that the item is a hard link to another item (requires --hard-links).
#   . means that the item is not being updated (though it might have attributes that are being modified).
#   * means that the rest of the itemized-output area contains a message (e.g. "deleting").

# The second character indicates what type of directory entry it is. Specifically:
#   f for file
#   d for directory
#   L for symbolic link
#   D for device
#   S for special file (e.g. socket or fifo   )

# The remaining columns are described below:
#   c means either that a regular file has a different checksum or that a symlink, device, or special file has a changed value.
#   s means the size of a regular file is different and will be updated by the file transfer.
#   t or T:
#       t means the modification time is different and is being updated to the sender's value
#       T means that the modification time will be set to the transfer time
#   p means the permissions are different and are being updated to the sender's value
#   o means the owner is different and is being updated to the sender's value
#   g means the group is different and is being updated to the sender's value
#   . unused

# The following columns may not be present, depending on your transfer options
# a means that the ACL information changed
# x means that the extended attribute information changed
